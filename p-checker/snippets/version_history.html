<h2>Release notes / Version history</h2>

<h4>Version 0.7 (2018-01-15)</h4>

Changes:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
Added PET-PEESE and Egger's test. Renamed tab to "Meta-Analysis".
PLEASE read the disclaimer on top of the meta-analysis tab: <i>The test statistics are converted to Cohen's d wherever possible, based on the formulas provided by Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein (2011). <b>Warning:</b> These effect size conversions are based on approximative formulas; furthermore the app always assumes equal cell sizes and other simplifications. Although these proxies work good under many conditions, this quick meta-analytic overview cannot replace a proper meta-analysis! For the same reasons, the results here might slightly differ from published results from a proper meta-analysis.</i><br>
You should rather see this as a quick prototyping/screening tool.
</li>
<li>
Fixed some signs and one-tailed stats in the glucose demo data.
</li>
<li>
Removed "Export" tab (the export link now is below the text entry field on the left side).
</li>
<li>
Slightly updated design
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug in TIVA: p-values are now one-tailed (as it should be). Thanks to Aurelien Allard and Katie Corker for reporting the bug.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 0.6.2 (2016-10-04)</h4>

Changes:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
	Changed TIVA computation to log(p), which allows much smaller p-values (thanks to Rickard Carlsson @RickCarlsson for pointing out the bug).
</li>
<li>
	Added power posing p-curve data from Joe Simmons and Uri Simonsohn (see <a href="http://datacolada.org/37">http://datacolada.org/37</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 0.6.1 (2016-06-14)</h4>

Changes:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>New "test statistic": You can now directly enter p-values (optionally with df in parentheses), based on a suggestion by Roger Giner-Sorolla. If df are provided, an effect size is computed based on a approximative conversion formula by (see <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=GC42CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=meta-analysis+convert+chi2+to+d+degrees+of+freedom&source=bl&ots=_c4EHEyRis&sig=yIaUDAbQ3RfPvLTfEE7-thpEXys&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiyp-XntdnLAhWipnIKHab5CaA4ChDoAQhfMAg#v=onepage&q=meta-analysis%20convert%20chi2%20to%20d%20degrees%20of%20freedom&f=false">here</a>).
	<br>Examples:</li>
	<ul>		
	<li>p=.034</li>
	<li>p(48)=.024</li>
	</ul>
</ul>


<h4>Version 0.6 (2016-02-22)</h4>

Changes:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Added 33% (or other) theoretical p-curve in plot</li>
<li>Moved comparison-power-slider to standard controls</li>
</ul>


<h4>Version 0.5  (2016-02-15)</h4>

Changes:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Included Begg's test for publication bias</li>
<li>Fixed bug in effect size plot</li>
<li>"Send to p-curve" now links to app4</li>
<li>Much improved parser (at least 100x faster)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li>TODO code clean-up: Clearly separate the inference functions from UI functions</li>
</ul>
