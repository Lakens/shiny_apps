<h3 id="data_extraction">Data extraction:</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>All</em> p-values can be extracted, both from focal hypothesis tests and from ancillary analyses, such as manipulation checks. But only p values are extracted for which precise dfs are reported (i.e., results such as &#8220;Fs &lt; 1, ps > .50&#8221; are <em>not</em> extracted).</li>
<li>Format:
<ul>
<li>Study ID: <em>teststatistic</em>; [optional] reported <em>p</em> value; [optional] 
critical <em>p</em> value; [optional, if one-tailed testing] one-tailed
<ul>
<li>[optional] reported <em>p</em> value: e.g., <code>p = .03</code>, or <code>p &lt; .05</code></li>
<li>[optional] critical <em>p</em> value: e.g., <code>crit = .10</code>, or <code>crit = .08</code></li>
<li>[optional, if one-tailed testing]: write the keyword <code>one-tailed</code>, or just <code>one</code>, or <code>1t</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The colon separates study ID from everything else</li>
<li>If the study ID starts with an underscore, this test statistic is <em>not</em> a focal test (e.g., from a manipulation check, a pre-test, or an ancillary analysis for possible alternative explanations), and will not be included in R-Index or p-curve analyses (but it will be included in the test for correct p-values)</li>
<li>The first datum after the colon must be the test statistic</li>
<li>All optional informations are separated by semicolons; can be given in any order</li>
<li>At the end of a line a comment can be written after a # sign (everything after the # is ignored)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>M&amp;E (2005) S1: t(25) = 2.1; p &lt; .05; one-tailed</li>
<li>M&amp;E (2005) S2: F(1, 45) = 4.56; p = .03   # wrong p value?</li>
<li>M&amp;E (2005) S3: chi2(1) = 3.7; crit=.10</li>
<li>_M&amp;X (2011) S1: r(123) = .08; p = .45     # this was a manipulation check (see underscore)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be careful if you <strong>copy &amp; paste</strong> the results from a PDF:
<ul>
<li>Sometimes there are invisible special characters. They are shown in the app as weird signs and must be removed.</li>
<li>The minus sign sometimes looks a bit longer (an &#8220;em-dash&#8221;). This should be replaced with a standard minus sign.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which tests to select in the presence of <strong>interactions</strong>? Some hints from Simonsohn et al.&#8217;s (2014) p-curve paper:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;When the researcher’s stated hypothesis is that the interaction attenuates the impact of X on Y (e.g., people always sweat more in summer, but less so indoors), the relevant test is whether the interaction is significant (Gelman &amp; Stern, 2006), and hence p-curve must include only the interaction’s p-value. [&#8230;] Simple effects from a study examining the attenuation of an effect should not be included in p-curve, as they bias p-curve to conclude evidential value is present even when it is not.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;When the researcher’s stated hypothesis is that the interaction reverses the impact of X on Y (e.g., people sweat more outdoors in the summer, but more indoors in the winter), the relevant test is whether the two simple effects of X on Y are of opposite sign and are significant, and so both simple effects’ p-values ought to go into p-curve. The interaction that is predicted to reverse the sign of an effect should not be included in p-curve, as it biases p-curve to conclude evidential value is present even when it is not.&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sign">Sign of effects</h3>
You can provide the sign of a test statistic (e.g., <code>t(123) = -2.8</code>). This, however, is ignored in R-index, TIVA, and <em>p</em>-curve, which only use the <em>p</em>-values and ignore the sign. Hence, for these analyses by now it is implicitly assumed that all effects go into the predicted direction. <br>The meta-analysis tab, in contrast, respects the sign.<br>



<h3 id="special_cases">Special cases</h3>

<ul>
<li>Significant studies are used to determine the success rate in the R-index analyses. But sometimes marginally non-significant <em>p</em> values (e.g., <em>p</em> = .051) are falsely rounded downwards and cross the critical boundary only due to this error (i.e., they are reported as &#8220;p &lt; .05)&#8221;). In this case, the ES does not count for a "success" (see column &#8220;significant&#8221; in the R-Index tab), as the actual <em>p</em>-value is not significant. But, if the ES has been (falsely) interpreted as significant by the original authors, the critical value can be slightly increased, so that the ES is also counted as a success in the R-Index analysis. In this case, increase the critical level to <code>crit = .055</code> for example. This decision (whether "near significant" studies, that are falsely interpreted as significant, should be included as "successes" in the R-index analysis) should be made a priori.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reproducible Analyses</h3>

<!-- You can provide the test statistics also in the link to this app. Copy your input text to the upper box of this <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/url-encoder.html#ad-output">URL Encoder</a>. In the lower box, you will find a weird-looking string, such as <code>t%2847%29%3D2.1%0D%0Ar%2834%29%3D0.123%0D%0AF%281%2C+200%29%3D9.9</code>. Now you can provide that string after the link to this app, for example:<br>
<code>http://shinyapps.org/apps/p-checker/?syntax=t%2847%29%3D2.1%0D%0Ar%2834%29%3D0.123%0D%0AF%281%2C+200%29%3D9.9</code><br> -->

Copy the link below the text entry area for a reproducible analysis. This way you can share any p-value analysis in a single link!

<h3 id="roxygen">Roxygen-style header for your analysis</h3>
You can add title, subtitle, details, and an URL for your analysis in the syntax:
<br>
<code>
#' @title The title of your analysis<br>
#' @subtitle by Slartibartfast<br>
#' @details Go and replace the examples in the text box!<br>
#' @url http://shinyapps.org/apps/p-checker/<br>
</code>


<h3>Technical Details</h3>

The Egger's test and PET-PEESE are implemented as:
<br>
<code>
PET <- lm(d~d.se, data, weight=1/d.var)<br>
PEESE <- lm(d~d.var, data, weight=1/d.var)<br>
<br>
PET <- rma(yi = d, vi = d.var, mods=d.se, method="DL")<br>
PEESE <- rma(yi = d, vi = d.var, mods=d.var, method="DL")<br>
</code>
